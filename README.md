## Autism_Diagnosis_with_CNN_Classifier_Project

#### This repository contains an end-to-end deep learning project for autism classification in children using MLOPS (Machine Learning Operations) principles. The project incorporates a DVC (Data Version Control) pipeline for efficient data management and model tracking. Additionally, it includes deployment scripts for deploying the trained model on AWS (Amazon Web Services).

#### Problem Statement:
#### Autism is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior in children. Early diagnosis and intervention can greatly improve outcomes for children with autism. This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify whether a child has autism based on images of children between age groups 2-6 years.

#### Dataset:
#### The dataset is used from Kaggle Website : https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/123978
